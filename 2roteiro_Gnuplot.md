## Introduction
In the previous video, we learned how to customize the appearance of lines in Gnuplot. In this video, we will explore the topic of colors in Gnuplot in details. We will learn how to define colors, search inspiration for color palettes and create our own color palette.

## Specify colors
In Gnuplot, we can specify colors of the lines with 'linecolor' or simply (lc) command followed by the specified color. There are three main ways to define colors in Gnuplot: 'colorname', 'colorspec', and the 'n' number of the linetype. 
**Create animation in MANIM showing the three ways to define colors in Gnuplot**

### Colorname
The 'colorname' is a string that represents the name of the color. Gnuplot knows a limited number of color names. To see the list of known color names, we must entry in Gnuplot enviroment and use the command: `show colornames'. Alternatively, we can use the command in the shell terminal: gnuplot -e 'show colornames'. This command reveals, we can see the list with 111 predefined colors with their values in HTML and RGB format.

### Colorspec
The 'colorspec' is a string that represents the color in a specific format, such as RGB or CMYK. 
Gnuplot supports several color specifications, including:
- RGB: `rgb "R,G,B"` where R, G, and B are values between 0 and 255.
- CMYK: `cmyk "C,M,Y,K"` where C, M, Y, and K are values between 0 and 1.

### N linetype
The 'n' number of the linetype is an integer that represents the index of the color in the color palette. 

The most common methods include:

1. **Named colors**: Gnuplot recognizes a set of named colors (e.g., "red", "green", "blue", etc.). You can use these names directly in your commands.
2. **RGB values**: You can define colors using their RGB components. The syntax is `rgb "R,G,B"`, where R, G, and B are values between 0 and 255.
3. **Hexadecimal values**: Similar to web design, you can use hexadecimal color codes (e.g., `"#FF0000"` for red).
4. **Color palettes**: Gnuplot supports color palettes, which are predefined sets of colors that can be applied to plots.

## Comments about versions of Gnuplot
Antes da vers√£o 5: Cada terminal (png, postscript, etc.) definia seu pr√≥prio conjunto de "linetypes" com combina√ß√µes espec√≠ficas de cor, espessura e padr√£o de tra√ßo. Embora a maioria usasse a sequ√™ncia vermelho/verde/azul/magenta/ciano/amarelo, n√£o havia garantia de consist√™ncia entre diferentes terminais.

A partir da vers√£o 5: O Gnuplot passou a usar uma sequ√™ncia de 8 cores independente do terminal. Isso significa que agora, por padr√£o, as mesmas 8 cores ser√£o usadas em todos os terminais, garantindo consist√™ncia visual entre diferentes formatos de sa√≠da.
