## The Power of Makefiles:  Automating Compilation
- Introducing Makefiles and their role in simplifying compilation processes.
- Demonstrating the Makefile structure for compiling the Fortran code with LAPACK.
- The benefits of using Makefiles:  efficiency,  reproducibility, and easier project management.

## Enter Makefiles: A Developer's Best Friend
- Makefiles – a simple, text-based recipe for your build process.
- Automate repetitive tasks like compilation, linking, and testing.
- Ensure consistent builds every time – no more unpredictable results.

## Compilation and Execution
- Walking through the compilation process using the Makefile, highlighting dependencies.
- Running the compiled executable to obtain the solution to the linear system.
- Verifying the results and discussing potential issues or error handling.
